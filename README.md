# Loan Approval & Credit Risk Prediction System

A full-stack Machine Learning web application that predicts loan approval status and calculates credit risk percentage based on applicant details.

The system integrates a trained ML classification model with a Flask backend and a React frontend. The backend is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment.

# Features

Loan approval prediction (Approved / Rejected)

Credit risk probability calculation (percentage-based)

REST API built with Flask

Interactive and responsive React frontend

Dockerized backend for consistent environment setup

Collaborative Git workflow using feature branches
